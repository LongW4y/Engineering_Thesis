# Welcome!
This repository contains the source code of an engineering thesis of my colleague(Jakub Sieklucki) and mine(Cezary Stanislawski).
We're students at **Poznan University of Technology**, with field of study being **Automatic Control & _Robotics_**, both majoring in **_Robotics_**.

## The topic
The topic of the thesis is "Automatic control of a four-jointed robotic arm with the usage of neural networks". 

While it tells most of the story, it definitely lacks lots of details.
