# Welcome!
This repository contains the source code of an engineering thesis of:
my colleague: Jakub Sieklucki,
and mine Cezary Stanislawski.

We're students at [**Poznan University of Technology**](https://put.poznan.pl/en?q=), at a **great** [*faculty of automatic control, robotics & electrical engineering*](https://goo.gl/maps/L2rSoj7zUiYd6xue9)

Our field of study is **Automatic Control & _Robotics_**, and we're both majoring in **_Robotics_**.

## The topic of the thesis
The topic of the thesis is "Automatic control of a four-jointed robotic arm with the usage of neural networks". 

While it tells most of the story, it definitely lacks lots of details, which I am going to describe now.
