# Welcome!
## What, who and where
This repository contains the source code of an engineering thesis of:  
my colleague - [Jakub Sieklucki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakub-sieklucki-538b32226/),  
and mine - [Cezary Stanislawski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cezary-stanis%C5%82awski-29b5781b5/). 

We're both students at [**Poznan University of Technology**](https://put.poznan.pl/en) in Poland, at a **great** [*faculty of automatic control, robotics & electrical engineering*](https://goo.gl/maps/L2rSoj7zUiYd6xue9). 
Our field of study is **Automatic Control & Robotics**, and we both major in **_Robotics_**.

## The thesis itself
The topic of the thesis is _"Image processing and reproduction by a robotic arm with the usage of machine learning"_, with our major advisor being **very knowledgable** [**D.Sc. Tomasz Pajchrowski**](https://zsep.cie.put.poznan.pl/index.php/researcher/tomasz-pajchrowski). 

With its details described below, the problems touched, are: 
_image processing with neural networks, automatic control of a robotic arm with machine learning, creation & maintenance of system architecture, action logging._

### An Overview
While the topic definitely can spark the imagination, it would be the best to give it a more detailed description.

## More detailed description


## Image processing 
The processing of images with **standard aspect ratios**, e.g. (Q/U/F/)HD, is fairly simple, as the height & width of the image is always divisible by the same (usually fairly large) number. 


## System architecture
