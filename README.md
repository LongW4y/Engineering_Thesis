# Welcome!
This repository contains the source code of an engineering thesis of:  
my colleague - [Jakub Sieklucki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakub-sieklucki-538b32226/), 
and mine - [Cezary Stanislawski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cezary-stanis%C5%82awski-29b5781b5/). 

We're both students at [**Poznan University of Technology**](https://put.poznan.pl/en?q=), at a **great** [*faculty of automatic control, robotics & electrical engineering*](https://goo.gl/maps/L2rSoj7zUiYd6xue9). 
Our field of study is **Automatic Control & Robotics**, and we're both majoring in **_Robotics_**.

## Topic of the thesis
The topic of the thesis is "Automatic control of a four-jointed robotic arm with the usage of neural networks", with our major advisor being **very knowledgable** [**D.Sc. Tomasz Pajchrowski**](https://zsep.cie.put.poznan.pl/index.php/researcher/tomasz-pajchrowski). 

While the topic itself tells most of the story, it definitely lacks lots of details, which I am going to describe below. 


## Image processing 
The processing of images with **standard aspect ratios**, e.g. (Q/U/F/)HD, is fairly *simple*, as the height & width of the image is always divisible by the same (usually fairly large) number. 

The real issue
