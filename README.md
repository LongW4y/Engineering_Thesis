# Welcome!
This repository contains the source code of an engineering thesis of:  
my colleague - Jakub Sieklucki,  
and mine - [Cezary Stanislawski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cezary-stanis%C5%82awski-29b5781b5/).  

We're both students at [**Poznan University of Technology**](https://put.poznan.pl/en?q=), at a **great** [*faculty of automatic control, robotics & electrical engineering*](https://goo.gl/maps/L2rSoj7zUiYd6xue9).

Our field of study is **Automatic Control & Robotics**, and we're both majoring in **_Robotics_**.

## Topic of the thesis
The topic of the thesis is "Automatic control of a four-jointed robotic arm with the usage of neural networks", with our major advisor being **very knowledgable [D.Sc. Tomasz Pajchrowski**](https://zsep.cie.put.poznan.pl/index.php/researcher/tomasz-pajchrowski)

While it tells most of the story, it definitely lacks lots of details, which I am going to describe now.
