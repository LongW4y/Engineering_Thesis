# Welcome!
This repository contains the source code of the engineering thesis of my colleague, Jakub Sieklucki, and me, Cezary Stanislawski. 

## The topic
The topic of the thesis is "Automatic control of a four-jointed robotic arm with the usage of neural networks". While it tells most of the story, it definitely lacks lots of details.
